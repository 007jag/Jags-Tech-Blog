## Description
---
This project is a tech blog site.Â  The intent of this project was to build a blog where tech enthusiasts could exchange their ideas, opinions, articles, and blog posts. When you first visit the site, the homepage displays previous blog posts as well as a navbar to help you navigate the site. If you attempt to move away from the site, you will be routed to the login page until you login. You'll note there's also a signup option on the login page. When you create an account, you will be instantly logged in. Whenever you sign up or log in, you will be taken to your dashboard, which serves as your landing platform.

## Usage 
---
Once you have completed the installation process, follow these steps to set up and run the program:

Open your terminal and navigate to the database file.
Type the command "mysql -uroot -p" and enter your password when prompted (note: keystrokes will not show).
Run the command "SOURCE schema.sql" to create the database and tables.
Alternatively, you can use the command "npm run resetdb" to reset the database with sample data. Enter your password when prompted.
Type "quit" to exit the MySQL interface.
In the root folder of the program, create a file called ".env" and include the following information:
DB_NAME='your-database-name'
DB_USER='your-database-user'
DB_PW='your-database-password'
DB_SESSION_SECRET='your-session-secret'
Open the "server.js" file in your integrated terminal.
Use the command "npm run seed" (or "node seeds/index.js") to populate the database with sample data (if desired).
Use the command "npm run start" (or "node server.js") to start the server. Alternatively, if you have Nodemon installed, use "npm run watch" (or "nodemon server.js").
Open your preferred web browser and go to 'localhost:3001' to view the program in action.
Use the login, logout, and signup features as needed, create new blog posts or edit existing ones, and add comments to blog posts.
When you are finished, use CONTROL-C to stop Nodemon in the terminal, and end the session.
